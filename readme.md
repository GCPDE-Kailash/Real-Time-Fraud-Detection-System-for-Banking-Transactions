----Project summery------
In my recent project, I developed a real-time fraud detection system 
for banking transactions on Google Cloud Platform. The system ingests streaming
 transaction data using Pub/Sub and processes it with Dataflow. 
 Processed data is stored in BigQuery, where we perform analysis to detect potential fraud. 
 For visualization, I used Data Studio to create interactive dashboards, 
 and I developed a web application for data interaction. 
 The application is deployed on Google App Engine, 
 and we implemented robust monitoring and logging to ensure reliability and performance.



-----------------------

### Project Overview
You will create a real-time fraud detection system for banking transactions on Google Cloud Platform. The system will ingest, process, store, analyze, and visualize streaming transaction data to detect and respond to potential fraudulent activities.

### Project Components
1. **Data Ingestion**
   - Use Pub/Sub to ingest streaming transaction data.
2. **Data Processing**
   - Use Dataflow to process and transform the data.
3. **Data Storage**
   - Store processed data in BigQuery.
4. **Data Analysis**
   - Use BigQuery to analyze the data.
5. **Data Visualization**
   - Use Data Studio to create interactive dashboards.
6. **Application Development**
   - Develop a web application to visualize and interact with the data.
7. **Deployment and Monitoring**
   - Deploy the web application using App Engine or GKE.
   - Implement monitoring and logging.

### Detailed Steps

#### 1. Data Ingestion with Pub/Sub
- **Setup Pub/Sub:**
  - Create a Pub/Sub topic for transaction data.
  - Create a subscription for the topic.
- **Simulate Data Streaming:**
  - Write a script to simulate banking transaction data (e.g., account number, transaction amount, timestamp) and publish it to the Pub/Sub topic.

#### 2. Data Processing with Dataflow
- **Create Dataflow Pipeline:**
  - Develop a Dataflow pipeline to read data from Pub/Sub.
  - Implement transformations to detect potential fraud (e.g., transactions exceeding a certain amount, multiple transactions in a short period).
  - Write the transformed and flagged data to BigQuery.
- **Optimize Pipeline:**
  - Implement windowing and triggering strategies.
  - Optimize for cost and performance.

#### 3. Data Storage in BigQuery
- **Setup BigQuery:**
  - Create a dataset and table in BigQuery to store processed transaction data.
- **Load Data:**
  - Ensure the Dataflow pipeline correctly loads data into BigQuery.

#### 4. Data Analysis with BigQuery
- **Write SQL Queries:**
  - Develop SQL queries to analyze transaction data and identify patterns indicative of fraud.
  - Create views and aggregations to facilitate reporting.
- **Scheduled Queries:**
  - Set up scheduled queries to automate periodic fraud detection analyses.

#### 5. Data Visualization with Data Studio
- **Connect Data Studio to BigQuery:**
  - Create a Data Studio report and connect it to your BigQuery dataset.
- **Create Dashboards:**
  - Develop interactive dashboards to visualize transaction data and fraud detection metrics.
  - Implement data controls and filters for user interactivity.

#### 6. Application Development with App Engine or GKE
- **Develop Web Application:**
  - Use a framework like Flask (Python) to create a web application.
  - Implement features to visualize transactions, flagged frauds, and interact with BigQuery for detailed analysis.
- **CI/CD Setup:**
  - Use Cloud Build to set up continuous integration and deployment.
- **Deploy Application:**
  - Deploy the application on App Engine or GKE.
  - Configure scaling options and environment variables.

#### 7. Monitoring and Logging
- **Setup Stackdriver Monitoring:**
  - Monitor application performance (e.g., response times, error rates).
- **Configure Stackdriver Logging:**
  - Capture application logs and metrics.
- **Create Custom Dashboards:**
  - Develop custom monitoring dashboards to visualize relevant metrics.

### Additional Considerations
- **Security:**
  - Implement IAM policies for access control.
  - Use VPC Service Controls or Firewall rules for network security.
- **Documentation:**
  - Document your project setup, configurations, and code.
  - Create a presentation or report summarizing the project.

### Deliverables
- **Source Code:**
  - Data ingestion script, Dataflow pipeline, web application code.
- **Documentation:**
  - Detailed documentation of each step, configurations, and code explanations.
- **Dashboards:**
  - Data Studio reports and Stackdriver monitoring dashboards.
- **Presentation:**
  - A final presentation summarizing the project, challenges faced, and solutions implemented.

### Example of a Fraud Detection Dataflow Pipeline
<!-- ```python
import apache_beam as beam
from apache_beam.options.pipeline_options import PipelineOptions, SetupOptions, StandardOptions
from apache_beam.io import ReadFromPubSub, WriteToBigQuery
import json
import os

# Set the Google Cloud credentials
os.environ["GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS"] = "df-pipeline-project-sa-authentication_key.json"

# Create the PipelineOptions object and configure it
pipeline_options = PipelineOptions()
pipeline_options.view_as(SetupOptions).save_main_session = True
pipeline_options.view_as(StandardOptions).streaming = True

class FraudDetection(beam.DoFn):
    def process(self, element):
        # Parse the JSON element
        transaction = json.loads(element)
        transaction_amount = transaction['amount']
        
        # Apply the fraud detection rule
        if transaction_amount > 10000:  # Example fraud detection rule
            transaction['fraud_flag'] = True
        else:
            transaction['fraud_flag'] = False
        
        # Yield the processed transaction
        yield transaction

def run():
    # Initialize the pipeline with the configured options
    p = beam.Pipeline(options=pipeline_options)

    (p 
     # Read messages from the Pub/Sub subscription
     | 'ReadFromPubSub' >> ReadFromPubSub(subscription='projects/df-pipeline-project-19062024/subscriptions/banking-sub')
     # Apply a global window with a trigger to process messages every 60 seconds
     | 'WindowInto' >> beam.WindowInto(
            windowfn=beam.transforms.window.GlobalWindows(), 
            trigger=beam.transforms.trigger.AfterProcessingTime(60),
            accumulation_mode=beam.transforms.trigger.AccumulationMode.DISCARDING
        )
     # Apply the fraud detection transformation
     | 'FraudDetection' >> beam.ParDo(FraudDetection())
     # Write the processed transactions to BigQuery
     | 'WriteToBigQuery' >> WriteToBigQuery(
            table='df-pipeline-project-19062024:banking_fraud.transactions_tbl2',
            schema='transaction_id:STRING, account_number:STRING, amount:FLOAT, timestamp:TIMESTAMP, fraud_flag:BOOLEAN',
            write_disposition=beam.io.BigQueryDisposition.WRITE_APPEND,
            custom_gcs_temp_location='gs://folder-temp/temp'
        )
    )

    # Run the pipeline and wait until it finishes
    p.run().wait_until_finish()

# Run the pipeline if this script is executed directly
if __name__ == '__main__':
    run() -->

This project will provide hands-on experience with real-time data processing and analytics, and demonstrate your ability to design, implement, and deploy a fraud detection system on GCP. Feel free to ask for any additional details or clarifications as you work through the project!
